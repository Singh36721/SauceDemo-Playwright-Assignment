# AI Disclosure
This project was created by me with assistance from an AI tool (Microsoft Copilot) for learning, debugging. I reviewed, modified, and validated all final code myself.

## AI Tools Used
- Microsoft Copilot  
Used for: 
- Help debugging network‑mock issues in Task F  
- Drafting documentation templates (README, DESIGN.md, etc.)

## Example Prompt Used
**Prompt:**  
“Help me write a MockAPI spec in Playwright using my matching existing POM style.”

## Author Responsibility
I reviewed and validated every line of code, executed all tests locally, and ensured the final implementation meets the assignment requirements.  
No confidential or proprietary data was included in any AI prompts.
